## Current Documentation

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files contain historical information that has been:
1. **Consolidated** into newer comprehensive docs (e.g., `FAILURE_MODES.md`, `EXECUTION_PATHS.md`)
2. **Superseded** by more detailed documentation (e.g., `WORKFLOWS.md` replaces `DEV_ERGONOMICS.md`)
3. **Outdated** but kept for historical reference

Files are preserved here for reference but should not be used as primary documentation sources.
